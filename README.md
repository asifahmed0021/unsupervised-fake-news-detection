# Unsupervised Fake news detection

## Introduction
Social media has become one of the main channels for people
to access and consume news, due to the rapidness and low
cost of news dissemination on it. However, such properties of
social media also make it a hotbed of fake news dissemination,
bringing negative impacts on both individuals and society.
Therefore, detecting fake news has become a crucial
problem attracting tremendous research effort.<br /><br /> Most existing
methods of fake news detection are supervised, which require
an extensive amount of time and labor to build a reliably annotated
dataset.<br />
Here there is an implementation of an unsupervised fake news prediction algorithm which does not require a classified dataset.<br />
<b>Along with implementing the paper we have also suggested and implemented an improvement which increases the performance of the algorithm by around 8-10% depending on the dataset</b>
